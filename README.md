# Cement_strength_prediction
## Description
* In the field of construction sector like mega buildings, bridges,etc… but you know that what is used to build these mega buildings, for construction we use material, cement, iron rods, etc.. where the material is a most important part of building making.
* For above problem every time we have to select best quality materials are time consuming,
* In this project I taken Best quality Cement strength for construction,
* concrete is made up of three basic components **Water**, aggregate, and portland cement. We know quality is the most important property for material used in building, if the quality of concrete is less then the build can’t stable but if we use the best quality concrete then the building is stable.    
* How we know that this concrete is quality proof or not, that we generally check the strength of concrete. In easy words the Compressive Strength of Concrete determines the quality of Concrete, we check it by standard crushing test on a concrete cylinder. Concrete strength is also considered a key factor in obtaining the desired durability. For testing strength it will take 28 days this is a large time, So what we will do now? By use of Data Science, we reduce this lot’s of effort we will predict that in how much quantity we have to use which raw material for good compressive strength.
